# This Application is for Test

I have prepared applications in Vue 3 and several other technologies, I try to use as much technology as I know. I also added the applications to the GitHub pages(https://makuchpatryk.github.io/coldrun-test/) so that they could be viewed.
I built this application in a modular form so that you can easily add new modules such as (employee, factory, customer). Just add a new folder to modules and connect the routing.

I didn't manage to prepare all the things I wanted to do. I still had plans:

- preparation of e2e tests in Cypress,
- expanding the list and adding the ability to add/remove/modify in bulk,
- adding a detail page for specific trucks,
- direct modification in the list, e.g. changing the status of a given truck,
- error mapping from the backend and better display of possible errors
