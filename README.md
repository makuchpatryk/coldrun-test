# This Application is for Test

I have prepared applications in Vue 3 and several other technologies, I try to use as much technology as I know. I also added the applications to the GitHub pages(https://makuchpatryk.github.io/coldrun-test/) so that they could be viewed.

I have connected two GitHub actions, one for deployment and the other for E2E tests, They are connected one after the other.
